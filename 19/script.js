/**
 * Ooh, tricky, fun, reminds me of 16, with the recursive valves...
 * 
 * Seems we want a recursive fn that takes Amt of time left,
 * number of Bots we currently have.. and Resources we have? And find best way forward? That max # of geodes we can crack?
 * Maybe not bots, but just resources?
 * 
 * One thing that sticks out... it should always be correct to build a geode-breaker, if possible.
 * There's no resaon not to, ever. 
 * Well.... is that true?? Idk.. if you had enough time... But we only ever care about like 24 turns.
 * 
 * I mean..yeah..it's very closely analgoous to 16...
 * Nodes are like pairs of Bots/Resources... and costs of "turning on a valve" are now costs of buying a bot...
 * How much difference does it make that you can now "visit the same node twice"?
 * Yeah... there's not really ever a point where you only have one node left to visit....
 * So what's the base case? 
 * hm....
 * Is it just "buy a geode-cracking bot if you can"?
 * Or I guess "you have a single minute/turn remaining"?
 * 
 * So in the recursive fn..
 * 
 * We would want to check all the avialable actions -- any available builds, and, do nothing.
 * 
 * We want to return sum of curr expected # of geodes... and # of geodes we would get if we took that action.. 
 * 
 * Base case is just where I'm tripping up. I guess if we only have 1 action? 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * What if we reorganize...around idea of Choosing Next Thing to Build.
